### Hi there! 👋🏿
✨ I'm **Chris** ✨ . I am **multidisciplinary** scientist working at the intersection of **`Chemistry`** ⚗️, **`Biology`** 🧫 , and **`Data Science`** 👨🏿‍💻

- 🗝 I’m currently working on identifying novel **Targets** 🎯 and **Biomarkers** in **Hematological Malignancies** and **Solid Tumors**
- 🔭 I’m currently learning more about **AI** 🚀 with a focus on **Deep Learning** and **Machine Learning** 🤖
- 💭 Ask me about **Immunology** 🧬, **Oncology**🔬 and **Chemical Biology**
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting **Bioinformatics** or **Cheminformatics** research projects
- 🤔 I’m thinking about novel approaches to **Drug Discovery** 💊 and **Targeted Therapy** ⚡
- I am passionate about **STEM Education** 📚 and **Social Justice** 💡
- 📫  You can connect with me directly at : **cetienn01@gmail.com**

### Computational Research Interests
- developing novel bioinformatics tools to investigate high-throughput genomics data to understand the mechanisms of diseases, with a particular interest in cancer
- applying computational methods to study biological processes such as protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand binding to design the next generation of cell permeable and orally bioavailable macrocyclic drugs.
- implementing machine learning algorithms to support classification and prediction of clinical outcomes using molecular features
