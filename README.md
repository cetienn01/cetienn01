### Computational Research Interests
- developing novel bioinformatics tools to investigate high-throughput genomics data to understand the mechanisms of diseases, with a particular interest in cancer
- applying computational methods to study biological processes such as protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand binding to design the next generation of cell permeable and orally bioavailable macrocyclic drugs.
- implementing machine learning algorithms to support classification and prediction of clinical outcomes using molecular features
